1. Make cart updates easier
    Not just removing whole items, but reducing the number.

2. Make Stash
    Can be used instead of just listings.

    Stash can include just a list of your cards, which some of them can later be listed for sale.

    User should be able to list a card directly without putting it in stash (but will automaticall be put into stash under "General" Group IG??

3. Shopping wizzard

4. Be able to whishlist just cards, no edition required, could be narrowed down with using filters for like wanting a foil or a specific rarity, but not the exact printing?

5. image caching
